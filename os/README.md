# Sura OS

This directory contains the bootable QEMU/OVMF integration image for Sura's
experimental freestanding x86-64 target.

`sura_os.sura` currently performs these operations in a virtual machine:

- starts as a UEFI x86-64 image generated directly from Sura source
- records the GOP framebuffer and allocates a 64 MiB-bounded backbuffer
- initializes the COM1 serial port
- obtains the UEFI memory map and calls `ExitBootServices`
- renders pixels, lines, rectangles, icons, and 5x7 bitmap text
- presents a double-buffered 1280x800-tested desktop with a terminal window,
  desktop icons, and a taskbar
- initializes the bitmap physical-page allocator from conventional memory
- allocates, writes, reads, and releases one physical page
- emits deterministic boot, memory, and kernel-ready markers
- runs a COM1 command shell and exits through QEMU's `isa-debug-exit` device

This is the first graphical desktop milestone, not a complete desktop
operating system. The visible terminal is currently a rendered preview; input
still uses COM1. There is no mouse, interactive window manager, application
process, persistent desktop filesystem, network stack, or browser yet.

The freestanding libraries also contain compile-verified scheduler, interrupt,
user-process, ELF64, PCI/PCIe, ACPI, block, partition, FAT32, AHCI, and NVMe
building blocks. Those subsystems are not all executed by this boot image yet.

Build and run the VM test from the repository root:

```powershell
.\tools\sura_os_vm.ps1 -Engine .\build\SuraLanguage_user.exe
```

Start an interactive serial shell:

```powershell
.\tools\sura_os_vm.ps1 -Engine .\build\SuraLanguage_user.exe -Interactive
```

Interactive mode opens the graphical QEMU window. Keep the PowerShell window
focused when entering serial-shell commands. For terminal-only automation:

```powershell
.\tools\sura_os_vm.ps1 -Engine .\build\SuraLanguage_user.exe `
  -Interactive -HeadlessInteractive
```

Capture the actual QEMU framebuffer after the desktop marker:

```powershell
.\tools\sura_os_screenshot.ps1 -Engine .\build\SuraLanguage_user.exe
```

The capture is written to `build\os\SuraOS-desktop.ppm`. The capture tool uses
QEMU QMP, requires `SURA_OS_DESKTOP_OK`, and then shuts the VM down normally.

The shell supports `help`, `status`, `mem`, `about`, and `shutdown`. Use
`shutdown` to close QEMU normally. The non-interactive VM test sends `status`,
`mem`, and `shutdown` through COM1 and checks their output.

The script uses QEMU with TCG emulation and an EDK2 x86-64 firmware image. It
does not modify firmware boot entries or boot the host computer. Interactive
mode connects COM1 to an ephemeral loopback-only TCP port so PowerShell handles
line input normally; it does not expose the shell on an external interface.
